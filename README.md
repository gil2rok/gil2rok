### Sup nerds, 👋 I'm Gilad

**I like to think about *probabilistic machine learning* research**, including:
- deep generative models (normalizing flows, diffusion, flow matching)
- statistical/Bayesian inference (variational inference, MCMC, sampling)
- AI4Science (inverse problems)

**Currently on my mind:**
- Discrete flow matching 🌊
- Running 100s of MCMC chains on GPUs ⛓️
- How to get rid of LaTeX compilation warnings ⚠️
- JAX is cool 😎
