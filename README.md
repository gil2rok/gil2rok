### Sup nerds, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gilad

**I think about *probabilistic machine learning* research**, including:
- deep generative models (normalizing flows, diffusion, flow matching)
- statistical/Bayesian inference (variational inference, MCMC, sampling)
- AI4Science (inverse problems)

**Currently on my mind:**
- Discrete flow matching ðŸŒŠ
- JAX is cool ðŸ˜Ž
