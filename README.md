### Hi there 👋. I'm Gilad Turok.

I broadly like *probablistic machine learning* including:
- deep generative models (normalizing flows, diffusion)
- computational statistics (variational inference, MCMC, sampling)
- principled understanding of deep learning (inductive biases, scaling laws, generalization)
- AI4Science (inverse problems)

Currently on my mind:
- Discrete flow matching 🌊
- Running 100s of MCMC chains on GPUs ⛓️
- How to get rid of LaTeX compilation warnings
