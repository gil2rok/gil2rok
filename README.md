### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Gilad Turok.

I like:
- probabilistic machine learning (variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo)
- generative models (diffusion, normalizing flows)
- better understanding deep learning (via generalization, scaling, efficency)

I also like open source code and pretending to know how to rock climb.
