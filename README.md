### Hi there 👋. I'm Gilad Turok.

I like:
- probabilistic machine learning/generative models (diffusion, normalizing flows)
- computational statistics (variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo)
- principled understanding of deep learning (inductive biases, scaling laws, generalization)
- AI4Science

Currently on my mind:
- Discrete flow matching 🌊
- Running 100s of MCMC chains on GPUs ⛓️
- How to get rid of LaTeX compilation warnings
