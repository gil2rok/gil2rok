### Sup nerds, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gilad

**I do *probabilistic machine learning* research** and am interested in:
- Generative models (normalizing flows, diffusion)
- Large language models (quantization, diffusion language models)
- Statistical inference & sampling (Bayesian computation,variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo)
- AI4Science (inverse problems)

**Currently on my mind:**
- Discrete flow matching ðŸŒŠ
- JAX is cool ðŸ˜Ž
